The solution is to carefully remove the invalid character from the CSS code.  The best way to detect these is using a hex editor or a text editor that reveals invisible characters. In most text editors, you can often display invisible characters with a setting such as "Show whitespace characters".

```css
/* Corrected CSS */
.my-element {
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
