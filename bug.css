The CSS code contains an invalid or unexpected character, such as a non-breaking space or a control character, that is not handled correctly by the browser. This can cause the CSS to be parsed incorrectly, leading to unexpected styling or layout issues.  For example:
```css
/* Invalid character */
.my-element { 
  color: red; 
  font-size: 16px; 
  
  /* Non-breaking space here */
  Â /*Notice the invisible character*/
  padding: 10px; 
}
```
