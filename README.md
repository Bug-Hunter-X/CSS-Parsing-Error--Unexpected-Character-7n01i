# CSS Parsing Error: Unexpected Character

This repository demonstrates a rather uncommon CSS bug: the presence of an invalid character (such as a non-breaking space or control character) within the CSS code, leading to unexpected rendering and styling behavior.  While common linting tools might miss this, it can cause significant headaches in debugging.

## The Bug

The `bug.css` file contains an invisible character that interferes with the CSS parser.  This can lead to styles being ignored or applied incorrectly.  The exact character might be a non-breaking space, control character or other unexpected input.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file corrects the issue by meticulously removing any unexpected, invisible characters.  Carefully review your CSS for hidden characters using a hex editor or text editor that shows invisible characters if you face similar problems.

This bug highlights the importance of maintaining clean and well-formatted CSS code and using tools to check for hidden characters.
